# Xamarin-Android-Real-time-Sensor-Data-Plot
Plotting orientation and acceleration data in real-time in two line charts. 
The orientation is calculated by combining data from the accelerometer and magnetic field sensors and lowpass filtered to remove noise.

- The orientation sensing implementation is based [Xamarin.Essentials](https://github.com/xamarin/Essentials/tree/56bc8dca66f274b44c3c1af87f578c75ddf1bd97/Xamarin.Essentials/Compass)
- The real-time charts are generated using the library [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart)
